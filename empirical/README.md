# Empirical Zone

Empirical workflows include:

- Delta Sharing discovery/export
- Ledger trace extraction
- Windowed comparison and diagnostics

Scripts are now in `empirical/scripts/`.
Legacy `data/*.py` commands are kept as compatibility shims.
Use `apps/run_empirical.py` as the stable launcher.
